    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. <br>
        By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking.<br>
        I have been making them this way for years!
    </P>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. <br>
            Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
