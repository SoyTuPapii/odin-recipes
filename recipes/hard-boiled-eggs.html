    <h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
    <P>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. <br>
        By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking.<br>
        I have been making them this way for years!
    </P>

    <ul>
        <li class="">8 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li><br>
        <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li><br>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li><br>
